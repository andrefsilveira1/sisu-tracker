# Sisu-tracker

# Motivation

In Brazil, there is an exam that allows the participants try an oportunity into Public Universities. The veterans use to welcome the new students
with course community, groups and forums. The problem is: Anyone can just sent a text and get the group link. Because of this, a lot of spammers, trolls and
non-students people got inside at university group. To solve this, I created a tracker that allows search by name, university, course and degree and check if someone 
really is approved. What makes easier and faster for groups administrators check if the guy who is talking with it is approved, just asking by the name. 

# How to use

just run: `node index.js [student name] [university name] [course name] [degree]`

Then, a message in terminal will display the result, if the name match or not

Notice that the script is not case sensitive, so, you do not have to write exactly is at the Sisu page. Furthermore, remember to write names between quotes or single quotes

# Next steps

Maybe read a `.txt` file will me easier instead pass the name as arguments
